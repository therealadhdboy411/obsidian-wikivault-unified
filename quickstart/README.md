# Quickstart Installation Guide

Follow these steps to manually install the **WikiVault Unified** plugin in your Obsidian vault.

## Installation Steps

1.  **Locate your vault's plugins folder**:
    - Go to your Obsidian vault's root directory.
    - Navigate to `.obsidian/plugins/`.
    - *Note: If the `.obsidian` folder is hidden, you may need to enable "Show hidden files" in your file explorer.*

2.  **Create a new plugin directory**:
    - Inside `.obsidian/plugins/`, create a new folder named `wikivault-unified`.

3.  **Copy the plugin files**:
    - Copy the following files from this `quickstart` folder into the newly created `wikivault-unified` folder:
        - `main.js`
        - `manifest.json`
        - `styles.css`

4.  **Enable the plugin in Obsidian**:
    - Open Obsidian.
    - Go to **Settings** > **Community Plugins**.
    - Click the **Reload** icon next to "Installed plugins" if you don't see WikiVault Unified.
    - Toggle the switch to **Enable** WikiVault Unified.

## Configuration

Once enabled, you can access the plugin settings to configure your AI provider (Mistral, OpenAI, LM Studio, etc.) and other preferences.
